Here is the Good Ol' Tsukuba Circuit! Enjoy. ;)
It just comes with two editions, one for the 2 laps and the other one is for only 1 lap.
the defaut is set to make 2 laps, and sector 1 time is showing the first lap time, and sector 2 showing second.
if you want to change it to 1 lap edition, then simply rename "track1lap.lua" to "track.lua" and that's it!

any comments will be much appreciated!

Special thanks to ElSaico's "Automation Track Builder - a visual track editor"
without his genius work, I wouldn't even think about making custom tracks.
