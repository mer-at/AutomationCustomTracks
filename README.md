custom community tracks for Automation

Tracks are all community made tracks from the automationgame.com forums.
This is just a repository for gamers, to have a convenient way to download all tracks at once.

Every track's folder got a file called "original-release.txt".
The url included there, will take you to the original release location in the automationgame forums.


Installation:
- unzip the zip file
- copy all Track Folders to Documents/My Games/Automation/Tracks
