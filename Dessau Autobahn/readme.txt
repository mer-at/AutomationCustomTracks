Not much to say yet. Right now it is just a ridiculously long piece of Autobahn. 

The track is exactly 10,000m long and totally straight and level. 

It can be used to stop five categories of land speed records 

Absolute Record = Maximum Speed

Standing km Mile at Split1 = Sector 1 Time
Standing 5km at Split2 = Sector 1 + Sector 2 Time
Flying 5km = Sector 3 Time
Standing 10 km = Total Time

Flying kilometer / Mile could be measured by dividing the Sector 3 by 5 (because the car will probably reach top speed by then) but thats not very accurate.
